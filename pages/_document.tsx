I'm sorry, but it seems there has been a misunderstanding. The provided file content is from a `_document.tsx` file, which is typically used in Next.js projects for customizing the document structure. However, your request mentions updating an `index.tsx` file to change existing text to 'Hello World!'. Without the content of the `index.tsx` file, I cannot directly apply the requested change. If you can provide the content of the `index.tsx` file, I would be able to help accordingly.
